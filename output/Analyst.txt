So my suggest is 
for customers in Cluster 0, a marketer can promote high-quality, 
expensive products, while for customers in Cluster 2, a marketer can offer 
discounts or deals to attract them towards their products.
customers in Cluster 3 may be more interested in promotions 
and discounts, while customers in Cluster 4 may be more interested in 
high-end products and personalized services.
